    TAKEAWAYS:
      1. Scala doesn't have "static" values/methods
      2. Scala Objects :
          * scala objects are in their own class
          * scala objects are the only instance
          * scala objects are singleton pattern in one line
      3. Scala Companions
         * can access each other's private members
